This repository gathers code and learning materials for hands-on experiments with modern generative modeling techniques, spanning variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and classifier-free guidance workflows. I, Felix Wilhelmy, maintain the collection and continue to iterate on the implementations.

## Repository overview

- `src/`: Core Python packages that implement the training loops, model definitions, and utility scripts for the experiments (including the VAE, DDPM, and classifier-free guidance components).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks that mirror the scripted pipelines and offer interactive walkthroughs, along with supporting figures stored in `notebooks/images/`.
- `Practical_HW__3.pdf`: Supplementary documentation outlining the experimental objectives, grading guidelines, and background reading.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to execute the scripts and notebooks.

For interactive experimentation I work either through the notebooks or the modular scripts, depending on workflow preferences and hardware access.

## Credits

Special thanks to Prof. Aaron Courville for guiding the overall direction of these materials. The original lab assistant scaffold came from Phil, whose starter code I then heavily modified throughout the repository.
